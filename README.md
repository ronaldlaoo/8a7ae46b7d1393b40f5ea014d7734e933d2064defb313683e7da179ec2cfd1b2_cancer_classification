- `notebooks/`: For Jupyter notebooks used during exploration and experimentation.
- `src/`: Organized modules:
  - `data_preprocessing/`
  - `feature_engineering/`
  - `model_training/`
  - `evaluation/`
  - `utils/`: Common helper functions
- `models/`: Saved model weights and artifacts.
- `outputs/`: Generated plots, prediction files, and logs.
- `config/`: Configuration files (e.g., hyperparameters, paths).
